The academic year of 2020/2021 is arguably one of the most challenging years for the NUS Angklung Ensemble. With the implementation of social distancing protocols, NUSAE has to face a lot of challenges which include not performing lives in the CAC largest annual concert, CAC+US. In the first Semester of AY 2020/2021, NUS implemented zoning restrictions for students from different majors. NUSAE was impacted by this arrangement that the club was unable to conduct physical sessions. Despite the obstacle, the NUSAE EXCO team still decided to conduct our practice sessions in a way that has never been done before, i.e. via an online zoom meeting. To achieve that, the Ensemble recruited more conductors this year and conducted training in small breakout room sessions. While the practice experience is quite different and rather slow, this online practice has its benefit. Due to the small size of our training group, every member in the club gets enough attention from the conductor to polish their play. In the second Semester, NUSAE finally gets permission to conduct physical practices under the condition of strict social-distancing rules. The EXCO team did their best to comply with the protocols and the club finally progresses well. In the end, we managed to cover songs like Get Lucky - Daft Punk, Love Yourself - Justin Bieber, and Viva La Vida - Coldplay. With COVID-19, AY2020/2021 has been a year full of challenges. Regardless, with all the effort and determination brought by our EXCO and members, the NUS Angklung Ensemble has proven to be resilient and ready to face the upcoming challenges.

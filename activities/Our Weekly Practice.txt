We have our biweekly practice at NUS CAC Clubroom. The collection of songs we play is extensive, ranging from the traditional Indonesian songs such as Manuk Dadali and Ayam Den Lapeh, to the modern tunes such as Pirates of the Carribean and Winter Games. Apart from that, we also organise a musical camp for all members at the end of the year to prepare ourselves for the upcoming performances and simultaneously build solid ties between the members. While the main activities during the camp are practising and reviewing the songs we have learnt, a series of exhilarating welfare events, is also held so that the members has the chance to get to know each other better.

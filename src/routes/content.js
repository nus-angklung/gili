            'We have been holding our annual concert since 2011, having the main purpose of showcasing angklung and introducing NUS Angklung Ensemble to the NUS community. In our 2015 concert, “The Chronicle”, we performed 13 well-known songs spanning diverse eras to take the audience in a journey through time. As the biggest concert in the history of NUS Angklung Ensemble, “The Chronicle” successfully attracted 150 people, including the Education Attaché of the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in Singapore, Mr. Ismunandar, and the manager of NUS Office of Student Affairs, Ms. Lyana Wang Wanzhen.',

            'We have our biweekly practice at NUS CAC Clubroom. The collection of songs we play is extensive, ranging from the traditional Indonesian songs such as Manuk Dadali and Ayam Den Lapeh, to the modern tunes such as Pirates of the Carribean and Winter Games. Apart from that, we also organise a musical camp for all members at the end of the year to prepare ourselves for the upcoming performances and simultaneously build solid ties between the members. While the main activities during the camp are practising and reviewing the songs we have learnt, a series of exhilarating welfare events, is also held so that the members has the chance to get to know each other better.',
